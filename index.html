# "Get Your Hands Dirty" JavaScript

This guide aims to get you *making things* in JavaScript.

It is written for beginner programmers, as *exercises* to do on your own and then ideally to *discuss* in a small group.

We'll be creating *interactive content* with JavaScript and HTML. Interactive content can change on its own or in response to a user's actions. It might also talk to other services on the internet--get the weather or post a tweet.

## Contents

[Introduction: Why I Wrote This](introduction.html). Where I talk about my philosophy behind the exercises and how this guide might be useful to you.

[Exercise 1: Word Count](word-count/index.html). Make a text area where the user can type and the program automatically counts the number of words in the text. You'll learn the basics of selecting objects with jQuery and how to execute code in response to user events.

Exercise 2: Whack-a-Mole. Make a game where a mole appears in a random spot and the user has to click it.

...

[Glossary](glossary.html). A list of words that programmers use and what they mean. (In progress.)
