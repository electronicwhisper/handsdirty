# Why I Wrote This

"Get Your Hands Dirty" is intended as a *supplement* to studying programming books or videos, or doing those little coding exercises in the browser. Those things are good to do, but they are not enough to master programming.

In a way this is my response to those things, specifically their "appeal to authority" approach. The book says this is the right way, or the computer judges whether you got the exercise right.

With the exercises in this guide, *you need to judge your own work*. There are many approaches to solving a problem. This is why ideally the exercises are done your own, and then discussed in a group. It is helpful to see many approaches to solving a problem: by doing so you will learn *why* the book says this is the "right" way, which is much more powerful than just knowing what the author claims is the right way.

## Programming Skills

Making things and developing programming skills go hand in hand. You can only develop skills by making things, and by developing skills you'll be able to make more things.

These are the skills that I believe are fundamentally important to programming and that I've tried to bring out through these exercises:

**Developing your personal iteration rhythm.** An iteration consists of writing a *small amount of code*, and then *confirming* that the code does what you expect. Confirmation might be checking if something showed up on the screen or that your code outputed something to the console. The practice is just repeating this process--code, confirm, code, confirm--until your program is complete!

Think of programming like rock climbing. To reach a far-off goal, you can't just take one giant leap. You need to get from one foot-hold to another, at each step regaining your balance before going for the next step.

Experienced programmers can sometimes take bigger steps. But programming mastery is less about big steps and more about *finding the foot-holds*--seeing how to break a problem down into simple sub-problems.

The exercises are designed to get you in the "code, confirm" rhythm. They start by taking little steps--showing you what type of steps you can take--then sending you off to find your own steps.

**Learning how to find and read documentation.** Reading documentation lets you *know what you can do*. Every programming language and library has documentation that tells you the "words" that it understands and how to use those words.

You'll need to learn to read this documentation eventually, so you might as well start now. The exercises do not give you enough information to solve them. You'll need to find documentation for JavaScript, jQuery, and any other library you use.

**Learning programming vocabulary.** The programming community has developed specialized words for talking about programming. By learning these words, you'll be able to *look up what you don't know* and *discuss programming issues with your peers*.

This guide comes with a [glossary](glossary.html) of programming words, and these words in the exercises are linked to the glossary.

**Learning how to debug.** A bug is something that happens that you didn't expect to happen. To fix a bug, you must *isolate* it. You need to answer the question: "Where is my code doing something that I didn't expect it to do."

This goes along with making small changes. If you make a small change and something breaks, then usually that means the bug is in the change you just did. Whereas if you type a ton of code all at once, *and then* you test it, if it doesn't work then you have more "code area" to search in order to find the bug.
